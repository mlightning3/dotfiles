# Dotfiles
My personal dotfiles for tools that I use. This is mostly so I can pull my files onto a new setup quickly, but feel free to use them as a stepping stone to make your own.

The files included come from many sources, such as tweaks applied to the stock Debian .bashrc or a .vimrc from many different suggestions on reddit. Because of that, don't feel like you need to give me credit for any of that, if you are worried about such things. 

The only special file is the linker script, which creates simlinks to the files in this directory with the files at their home/standard locations.
